1. Set up your development environment: <br>
`
Make sure you have a web server (e.g., Apache) and PHP installed on your system. You can use solutions like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP for easy setup on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Install MySQL or any other relational database management system you prefer.
`
2. Create a project directory:<br>
`Create a folder for your project, for example, student_management, in the web server's document root directory.`
3. Set up the database:<br>
`Use a MySQL client (such as phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench) to execute the SQL commands provided earlier to create the student_management database and the students table within it.`
4. Create the necessary files:<br>
`Create the PHP files (config.php, add_student.php, get_students.php, update_student.php, delete_student.php) and the HTML file (index.php) in your project directory.`<br>
`If you're using CSS for styling, create a CSS file (style.css) in a subdirectory named css within your project directory.`
5. Write the PHP and HTML code:<br>
`Write the PHP code for connecting to the database, handling CRUD operations, and retrieving data.`
`Write the HTML code for the user interface, including forms for adding and editing students and displaying the list of students.`
6. Run the project:<br>
`Go to the project directory`
`Open directory in TERMINAL`
```
    php -S localhost:8000<br>![Screenshot 2024-06-23 180106](https://github.com/surajkumar2098/student_management_php/assets/173556943/7a4ce9cf-6062-4368-aaef-88ef83fc7f8a)

```
# OR
`you can run it on xampp as well where you just have start apache and mysql`
`go on your browser and type localhost/student_management/`


### php ERROR
1. Install XAMPP
2. Add C:/XAMPP/php in PATH variables
